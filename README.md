DeleteDup
=========
This is another project I worked on in school.
This program deletes the last duplicate/second to last Duplicate of a set of integers.
These integers can be inserted by two methods:
<p>
//Sorted insert - the integer being inserted into the list will be sorted automatically
<p>
//Insert - the integer will be put at the end of the list
<p>
After creating list of integers, a fucntion can be called to delete either the last duplicate of all the
integers or the second to last duplicate of the given integers.
